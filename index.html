         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying business administration. I work for the Dining Common on campus and am a server who sets up dinner.</p>
         <p>
            I do not have a current church but am in the process of looking for one. I was attending Palmetto Baptist Church in Powdersville, South Carolina and working 
             in their nursery, but the Lord showed me some things about the church I did not agree with and I left that church.</p> 
         <p>
            I enjoy playing chess and meeting new people.
